Summary:

I made This Database using MySQL workbench. I started this project by looking at the given data of greenspot
and I manualla organized and typed everything to exel so I could learn about the data and better organize it.
this was very helpful when making tables and columns and organizing data.
I also used Microsoft Word to write down ideas how to structure this database I wrote how tables and columns should be on database
So then I started working on the project creating query ''Greenspot''
