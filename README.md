Summary:

I utilized MySQL Workbench to develop a comprehensive database solution for greenspot, commencing with a detailed examination of the provided data. Manually organizing the data in Excel enabled a deeper understanding and facilitated efficient structuring of tables and columns. Microsoft Word was employed to meticulously outline the database's architecture, ensuring clarity in the design process.

The project progressed with the creation of seven tables, each featuring a unique primary key and interconnected via foreign keys to establish relational integrity. Despite initial uncertainty regarding the approach, emphasis was placed on ensuring data accessibility and coherence across tables, simplifying the use of join functions while facilitating efficient data retrieval.

Thorough testing, including basic functions and join operations, validated the database's functionality, ensuring reliability in essential operations. The constructed database comprises seven key tables: Products, Product_information, Vendor, Customer, Items, Sales, and Orders, each serving a distinct purpose in managing greenspot's data effectively.

The foreign key relationships were meticulously established to maintain data consistency and facilitate seamless data retrieval across interconnected tables. Notably, Orders are linked to Customers, Vendors to Product_information, and Sales to both Orders and Products, ensuring comprehensive data management and analysis capabilities.

In summary, the database solution offers a structured and scalable framework for greenspot's data management needs, enhancing efficiency and facilitating informed decision-making through organized and interconnected data structures.
